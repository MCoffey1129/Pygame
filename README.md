Alien Attack Pygame (similar to Space Invaders)
====

Summary
--
Please find attached pygame code for running a game I created called "Alien Attack." The game is quite similar in nature to "Space Invaders."   
The purpose of creating this code is to try and train a Neural Network to play the game and get a 
higher score than the 5 random scores I got when playing the game. 

For anyone interested please feel free to take my code and create your own game. The code is quite heavily commented 
but I am happy to answer any questions anyone may have. Please note it would not have been possible
to create the game without the following excellent website -  http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?lang=en.


How to play the game
===

Controls
--
Mouse - Shoot  
Left arrow - move left  
Right arrow - move right  
Up arrow - move up  
Down arrow - move down  


Scoring
--
The aim of the game is to maximise your score within the 3 minute time-limit
(or until your life/health decreases to zero). You score points by shooting the aliens.

There are 3 types of aliens:

***Blue aliens***  
These move down the screen at a regular speed. You get 100 points for each alien you hit.  
***Green aliens***   
These move horizontally across the screen very quickly. You get 300 points for each green alien you hit.  
***Pink aliens***  
These move down the screen twice as fast as the blue alien. You get 500 points for each pink alien you hit.  

Life
--
Your health is 100 at the start of the game. Each time you collide with an alien your health/life
decreases by 10. When your life falls to zero the game is over.
